This layer is the heart of the core autonomous functionalities of the Turing Board. We use computer
vision and depth imagery to determine the boardâ€™s surroundings and calculate the best path to move
forward. The user will have, strapped around their ankle, an anklet-like contraption consisting of a
pattern of ArUco markers for the Follow Along feature. This layer tracks the movement of the user
through the anklet to determine how to instruct the combination of motors to move so as to follow the
user at an appropriate pace. It is also responsible for detecting possible obstacles when operating on its
own to find the user as part of the Summon feature.
\subsection{Layer Hardware}
The required hardware components include the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as the main compute module and the Intel RealSense  D432 Depth Camera.

\subsection{Layer Operating System}
The NVIDIA Jetson TX2 is running Ubuntu 18.04. 

\subsection{Layer Software Dependencies}
This layer requires the OpenCV v4.2.2 or higher compiled with cuDNN enabled. A more detailed and exhaustive list can be obtained from. https://github.com/TuringBoard/turing-board-vision/blob/main/Configuring%20the%20NVIDIA%20Jetson%20TX2.md.

\subsection{RGB Imagery Subsystem
}
RGB Imagery of the front of the board is used as input in making various position specific calculations pertaining to navigation.
