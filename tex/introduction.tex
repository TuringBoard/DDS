The Turing Board is a concept autonomous longboard which is capable of exhibiting self-driving capabilities using computer vision. Users of the Turing Board will be able to take advantage of various features such as having the board follow you autonomously and having the board summon itself to you from a parked location, in addition to functioning as a standard electric longboard capable of recording and analyzing all trip data. Users will also be able to use the Turing Board to function as a load carrier, relieving them from the burden of carrying everyday items like backpacks, boxes, etc. if desired. 
The main components of the Turing Board include a remote control via an app on the user's phone, the Jetson TX2 controlling the software signals and output to other components of the board, the motorized wheels and turning mechanism, computer vision, human-machine interface, and the board's power supply.
